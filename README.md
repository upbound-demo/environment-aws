# Example Environment for AWS

This repo contains manifests to manage control planes in an Upbound Environment
deployment. It utilizes IRSA to authenticate to AWS.

## Get Started

### Preparing Your Own Repository

* Fork the repo and clone your fork.
  * This is needed so that you can push details specific to your clusters and
    have FluxCD pick them up from that repo.
* Replace the following strings with values specific to your cluster:
  * `oidc.eks.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/id/C09D53376BDFD92A00BD5042AE19AEFF`: Run
    the following command and replace the output with all instances.
    ```bash
    # CLUSTER_NAME should be the name of your EKS cluster.
    # REGION should be the region your EKS cluster resides in.
    aws eks describe-cluster --name ${CLUSTER_NAME} --region ${REGION} --query "cluster.identity.oidc.issuer" --output text | sed -e "s/^https:\/\///"
    ```
  * `609897127049`: You need to replace all instances of this number with your
    AWS account ID which you can get with the following command:
    ```bash
    aws sts get-caller-identity --query "Account" --output text
    ```
* Create a new commit to push changes.

### Bootstrapping Flux

* Create a [Github Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with access to your fork of this
  repository. If it's public, `public_repo` under `repo` should be enough.
* Bootstrap Flux in your EKS cluster.
  ```bash
  # GITHUB_ORG is the Github organization your fork resides in.
  # REPO is the name of the repository of your fork.
  # GITHUB_PAT is the personal access token you just created.
  echo "${GITHUB_PAT}" | \
  flux bootstrap github \
    --owner=${GITHUB_ORG} \
    --repository=${REPO} \
    --branch=main \
    --path=./main \
    --token-auth
  ```
* Once it's finished, you can see the control planes.
  ```bash
  kubectl get controlplane
  ```
  You can see the `Role`s that are created for each control plane as well.
  ```bash
  kubectl get role.iam
  ```

Enjoy!
